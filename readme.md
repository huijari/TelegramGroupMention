# Telegram Group Mention
Create custom mentions in your Telegram chat, much like Discord's role mentions.

## Usage
* `/create_foo` to a create a group mention called `foo`
* `/enter_foo` to subscribe to a group mention called `foo`
* `/exit_foo` to unsubscribe from a group mention called `foo`
* `/delete_foo` to delete a group mention called `foo`
* `/list_foo` to list members of mention `foo` without tagging them
* `/mentions [username]` to list the group's mentions, optionally passing an username filter (use `me` for your own mentions)
* `@admins` to tag group admins
